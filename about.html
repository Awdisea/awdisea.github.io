            There was a time when Walt Disney would have a released an aniimated film only to watch it bomb. Creating animation is
            a very expensive undertaking. Disney was able to significantly reduce the cost of producing an animated film by only
            proceeding with the animation once a rough mockup of the film was given positive reviews by an internal
            team. The mockup would require scanning a lot of hand skteches and adding narration and music. You can watch this video
            of Steve Jobs describing this during an interview:

                The process of testing your idea during pre-production seems to have been something forgotten by Hollywood over time,
                as can be seen with the countless poor quality movies they've been producing over the past 20 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                YouTube videos may not be on the same level as full Hollywood production movies, but even a high quality 15 minute
                YouTube video often requires higher production costs. Many YouTubers have been successful with virtually no
                production costs and simply record a video of themselves doing something.
            </p>
            <p>
                But with nearly 4 million videos uploaded every day to YouTube, it becomes increasingly more difficult to
                become noticed and retain subscribers. If the YouTube algorithm does decide to promote your video, it could be a make or break
                deal based on nothing more than your video thumbnail and title with the thumbnail taking precedence. Many viewers
                won't even bother to read the video title if the thumbnail doesn't connect with them.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                And yet there are YouTubers that are able to produce consistently better quality videos over time and grow their
                channel. While there are many factors that go into producing a succcessful video, the primary reason why they
                succeed is because they produce highly engaging content that the majority of their subscribers enjoy watching. Behind
                these videos are creative people who have developed a mindset to recognize what viewers find interesting in their work
                and focus on that type of content. Zach King is one of those gifted creators. While he may have 40 million subscribers
                as of 2024, much of his earlier work bombed. The same could be said of MrBallen - a channel that specializes in
                "the strange, dark and mysterious".
            </p>
            <p>
                Many YouTubers who aspire to become as creative as their role models, wish they could spend a day with them, get
                to know them, see how they work and peer into their way of thinking. For most people, this is never going to happen.
                The next best thing to getting inside of their heads is using Artificial Intelligence, and this is where
                Awdisea comes in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Awdisea is based on an AI that tries to get as close to recreating the elements that go into the thought
                process of coming up with a great idea before even beginning any production on the video. As humans, we
                are subconscious about those elements. For example, you don't really think about the age group or gender
                you are targeting. If you're a 25 year old woman doing makeup videos, you already know who the vast
                majority of your viewers are. But the YouTube algorithm doesn't. It does try to figure it out using AI. For
                the most part it gets it right. While there are many parameters that the algorithm uses to figure out
                what to recommend to viewers, the title of your video and the similar videos that your subscribers are
                watching are the two biggest parameters. YouTube doesn't even use the thumbnail. This is because thumbnails
                are so vastly complex that even AI can't tell what makes a great thumbnail. But humans on the other hand
                are instantly captivated by a thumbnail while scrolling through suggested videos. Most people will only
                read the title if the thumbnail draws their attention and they want to have more context about the video.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the YouTube algorithm cannot use the thumbnail when it comes to recommending your video to others,
                it depends much on the title to find viewers who have already watched videos with similar titles. This is
                why your YouTube home feed always gets a lot of suggestions of similar videos whevener you watch just a few
                videos that have related titles. The algorithm also relies heavily on your existing subscribers.
                If a large portion of your subscribers watch a new video you post,
                it will recommend the video to others who have watched similar videos. But unless enough of your
                subscribers watch the video, it is very unlikely that the algorithm will even bother to recommend it to
                others.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is highly recommmended that you read the documentation on how the YouTube algorithm actually works so
                that you can better understand how it influences your video views and how Awdisea is able to
                help you overcome the major challenge in growing your channel.

            <p>
                By breaking down the conscious and subconscious thinking process that goes into coming up with an
                idea for a video and creating parameters on a granular level, it is possible to feed this data
                into a neural network that AI models are built on and then with fairly good accuracy predict
                how many views a video will get. The AI model does however need additional channel metrics to make this
                work. These metrics include things like the number of subscribers you have, how many total views your
                channel got, how often you upload, the number of likes, dislikes and comments your channel has on average,
                what is the average percentage of subscribers that watch new videos you post, and a host of other data.

            <p>
                Instead of trying to crack the YouTube algorithm, YouTubers need to crack the thinking process of
                what goes on inside the minds of really good creators. That is really what Awdisea is all about. It helps
                YouTubers break down their thinking process into actual data. It then takes this data and predicts how
                well the video might do based on how well similar videos did - not only from your channel but also from
                other channels that produce videos similar to yours. Provided that you supply Awdisea with enough
                relevant data and publish your video using the thumbnail and title that you provided it with, Awdisea will
                later on check how well the video performed and compare it to what it predicted and then adjust its
                neural network to improve the accuracy. Initially the accuracy will be off but over time it will improve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Training Awdisea's AI model does require some human interaction in order to help guide the AI avoid making
                wrong choices. But over time, human interaction decreases as the model becomes more accurate.
            </p>
            <p>
                As more YouTubers who produce content similar to yours use Awdisea to train the model, predictions become
                even more accurate. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you reach out to similar channels and
                tell them about Awdisea and get them to use it as part of their pre-production.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some YouTubers are in a financial position where they can afford to produce a short clip of the video
                without having to produce the entire video. For those in this position, it would be extremely
                advantageous if this clip could be reviewed and feedback provided not just to the AI but also the YouTuber who
                produced the clip. This is effectively what Walt Disney
                was doing. The ideal way to do this is to produce only the first minute of the video and make it
                privately available to only a portion of your subscribers. These selected subscribers must not in
                any way be persuaded to watch the clip. That defeats the purpose of the test. The test is to see whether
                they are attracted to the thumbnail and possibly the title, to be engaged enough to want to watch the clip.
                If they do choose to watch it, the amount of time they spend watching it is recorded. This is
                one of the most important metrics YouTube Studio shows on videos. You want to know at what time in the video
                users start dropping out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately YouTube doesn't offer this kind of test environment. Some YouTubers get around it by showing
                preview clips in advance to paying Patreon members. While Awdisea currently does not support enlisting a
                channel's subscribers, it is on the list of TODO things that will eventually be available. The reason you
                want input from your subscribers is because the YouTube algorithm places important value on how your
                subscribers react before suggesting it to others. If you can't get enough of your own subscribers to
                watch the video, the algorithm isn't going to bother recommending it to anyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, Awdisea is about an AI whose only purpose is to figure out the thinking process that went
                into deciding what video to make and tracking whether that thinking process resulted in a very good
                video performance. It then lets other YouTubers who produce similar content to tweek their own thinking
                process along the same lines as those YouTubers who made better videos. It isn't about duplicating
                someone else's videos but rather about adopting parts of someone else's way of thinking to help improve their 
                own videos.
