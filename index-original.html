        <p>Awdisea is an AI powered tool that can predict how many views a video will most likely get within a week even before the video is created. At the very minimum, it
            can predict the number of views solely on the videoâ€™s title and thumbnail, giving the least accurate prediction, or it can achieve a much higher accuracy when
            additional data is used such as the number of subscribers, total channel views, number of videos uploaded and many other parameters.</p>
        <p>Awdisea provides 3 different levels of accuracy prediction with the lowest level being the least accurate and the top level being the most accurate. Each level
            depends
            on more data that the AI model gets trained with.</p>
        <p>Publishing a video and hoping it will be successful is just rolling the dice. Use Awdisea to increase your chances of creating a successful video.</p>
